                    <p>Izzie is an active member of NCGREEN committed to learning and educating about responsible interaction with the environment. A passionate supporter of local agriculture, 
                    equitable and conscientious food systems, community building, the preservation of natural spaces, and more, Izzie recognizes the intersections between these ideas and the 
                    importance of working together to make our world a better place. Having grown up on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, Izzie has felt a deep connection with nature since she was young, 
                    and hopes to continue to demonstrate her appreciation of it in the work she does in her community and beyond.

                    <h3>Kendall Williams</h3>
                    <p>Kendall's role as a member of NCGREEN is as a functional marketer of sorts. Her goal has been to increase digital awareness of both the function of NCGREEN and of broad sustainability practices.
                    While environmental conservancy has been a recent focus, she has always had a growing concern for the state of our Earth and hopes to bridge her experiences with digital marketing to 
                    her passion for saving and restoring nature.
                    In her free time, Kendall loves to take a blanket and a book and lay outside in the sun.
